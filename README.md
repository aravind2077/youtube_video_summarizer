# youtube_video_summarizer
An ML project to help summarize YouTube Videos.

This project is written in python. It uses YouTube API to extract captions and form a transcript of a video.
It then uses HuggingFace Transformer to create a summary from the transcript.
You can choose the verbosity of the summary.
  There is a check to make sure the verbosity is not more than the word count of the transcription
